# Final-Project-5463
3R robot arm picks up an object from one location and places it at another.

To run the program, make sure to have Python 3.9+ installed on your device.
Open Script.py in VS Code and make sure to have matplotlib.
If not type the line below into the terminal:

pip install numpy matplotlib

Once everything is set up hit Run in the top right hand corner.
The program should display a simulation of the robot arm completing the task and graphs of the x, y, and z trajectories.
